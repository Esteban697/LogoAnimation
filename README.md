# Logo Animation
### by Esteban Struve

This is a small project to add a cool animation to the logo of my personal brand UXin3D.
The "User EXperience in 3D" focuses on the user and the **feeling** when experiencing the apps I create.
The overall elements & aspects around the app that you create and shape as developer needs to be based
exclusively of the user and the bond he/she creates with it.
